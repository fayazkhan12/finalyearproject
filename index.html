    <h3><b> ABOUT ONCAMPUS PLACEMENT</b></h3>
    <p>
        Campus placement refers to the process where employers visit educational institutions such as colleges or universities to recruit students for various job positions. This process is common in many countries and is a convenient way for both employers and students to connect. Here's a general overview of how campus placement typically works:

        Pre-placement Talks (PPTs): Companies often begin the process by conducting pre-placement talks on campus. During these sessions, representatives from the company provide information about the organization, the job roles they are offering, the selection criteria, and other relevant details.
        
        Registration and Eligibility: Interested students usually need to register for the placement process. Companies may have specific eligibility criteria based on academic performance, skills, and other factors.
        
        Resume Submission: Students interested in participating in campus placements typically submit their resumes to the placement cell. The placement cell then shares these resumes with the companies.
        
        Shortlisting: Based on the resumes and sometimes pre-placement tests, companies shortlist candidates for further assessment. This could involve written tests, group discussions, technical interviews, and HR interviews.
        
        Interviews: Shortlisted candidates are invited for interviews, which can be technical interviews to assess their skills and knowledge related to the job, as well as HR interviews to evaluate their soft skills, communication abilities, and cultural fit within the organization.
        
        Offer Letters: Candidates who successfully clear the interview rounds may receive job offers from the companies. This includes details about the role, compensation, benefits, and other terms and conditions.
        
        Acceptance and Joining: Students who receive offers then decide whether to accept or decline them. If they accept, they typically go through the joining process, which may involve completing necessary paperwork, background checks, and other formalities.
        
        It's important for students to prepare thoroughly for campus placements by improving their technical skills, communication skills, and general awareness. Additionally, being aware of the companies visiting the campus and researching their requirements and expectations can be beneficial.
